Create a fully responsive, Pinterest-style dynamic gallery page for a school website.
The gallery must feel human-made, visually rich, and extremely attractive for parents and students.
Use a masonry grid layout (Pinterest-like) that automatically adjusts image sizes and positions based on height and screen size.
The images will be uploaded dynamically from the backend, so the layout should support infinite/auto loading, lazy loading, smooth animations, and perfect responsiveness on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Key Requirements:

Use React for the frontend.

Use a Masonry/Pinterest layout (CSS Masonry, Flex Masonry, or any React Masonry library).

Auto-flow grid based on image height.

Add soft shadows, gentle hover zoom-in animations, and rounded corners (12px–20px).

All images should auto-fit without breaking aspect ratio.

Include lazy loading for performance.

Add category filters (e.g., Events, Competitions, Celebrations, School Life).

Add year-wise filters (optional).

On click, open each image in a beautiful fullscreen lightbox with arrows to navigate between photos.

Make it SEO-friendly and optimized for fast load times.

Make it visually aesthetic with school-friendly color palette and subtle backgrounds (no AI-template style).

No cropping or distortion — maintain image quality.

Admin Side Requirements:

Admin should be able to upload images dynamically from admin panel (drag & drop upload recommended).

The uploaded images must appear instantly in the gallery grid.

Backend image link or cloud storage (e.g., Firebase, Cloudinary, S3) should load into gallery dynamically.

Use a clean API structure to fetch images in JSON format.

UI/UX Requirements:

Use soft pastel school-friendly colors.

Add a subtle textured or gradient background (very light, not distracting).

Smooth fade-in animation when images load.

Masonry layout must rearrange beautifully on all devices.

Use readable labels and titles for every category.

Overall Goal:

Build a Pinterest-like gallery that makes the school look vibrant, lively, and visually appealing.

Make it feel handcrafted, aesthetic, and premium — not like a generic AI website."**
